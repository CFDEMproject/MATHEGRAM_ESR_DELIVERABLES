- solutions for a compressible flow in a one-dimensional packed bed

- analytical solutions for idealised situations: 
   - friction or Fanno regime (adiabatic, constant void fraction); 
   - heated or Rayleigh regime (frictionless, constant void fraction, with heat
     addition or removal); 
   - nozzle/diffuser regime (frictionless, adiabatic, but with linear
     increase/decrease in void fraction). 

- numerical solutions for flow with friction (particle-fluid drag), 
  non-constant void fraction, and heat addition/removal
