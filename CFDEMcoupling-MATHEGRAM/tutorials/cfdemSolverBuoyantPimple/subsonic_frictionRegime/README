- verification of a compressible flow solver for a 'friction' or 'Fanno' regime

- one-dimensional fixed bed, with uniform void fraction

- friction stemming from drag forces

- adiabatic condictions

- fluid pressure, velocity, temperature, and density compared to analytic 
  solution (Macak, Goniva and Radl, Powder Technol, 2021)
