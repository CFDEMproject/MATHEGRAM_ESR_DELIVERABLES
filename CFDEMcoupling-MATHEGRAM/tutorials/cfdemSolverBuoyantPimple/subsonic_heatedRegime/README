- verification of a compressible flow solver in 'heated' or 'Rayleigh' regime

- one-dimensional fixed bed, with constant void fraction

- heat source imposed at the particle phase

- small friction force, stemming from drag forces

- fluid pressure, velocity, temperature, and density compared to numerical  
  solution (Macak, Goniva and Radl, Powder Technol, 2021)
