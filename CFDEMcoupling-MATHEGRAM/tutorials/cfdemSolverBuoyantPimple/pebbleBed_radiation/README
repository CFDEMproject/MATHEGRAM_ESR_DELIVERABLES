- verification of radiative heat transfer with P1 model

- small pebble bed in vacuum

- no conduction, no convection

- temperature profile tested against an analytical solution 
  (Heaslet and Warming, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 1965)
  and a view-factor--based numerical solution 
  (Tausendschoen and Radl, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 2021)

- pseudo-scattering used for the removal of heat flux fluctuations

- more details in Macak, Goniva, Radl "Predictions of the P1 approximation for 
  radiative heat transfer in heterogeneous granular media" (2022)
