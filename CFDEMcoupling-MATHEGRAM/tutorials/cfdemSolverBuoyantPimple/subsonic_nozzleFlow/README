- verification of a compressible flow solver in 'nozzle' regime

- one-dimensional fixed bed, with linear increase in void fraction

- adiabatic condictions

- small friction force, stemming from drag forces

- fluid pressure, velocity, temperature, and density compared to numerical  
  solution (Macak, Goniva and Radl, Powder Technol, 2021)
